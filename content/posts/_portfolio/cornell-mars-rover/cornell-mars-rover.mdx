  The Cornell Mars Rover team builds an innovative semi-autonomous rover to assist in a future mission to Mars.
</Text>

Cornell Mars Rover was the first group I joined in college as a starry-eyed freshman.
Getting accepted into an engineering project team is a competitive endeavor at Cornell,
so I felt lucky to join 40+ other teammates passionate about the future of space exploration.

The team was founded in 2010, so as one of the newest teams on campus, 
there was plenty of work to do to make the team reach its potential.
Initially, I built up my technical chops by writing code for our rover's Controls Interface. 
But quickly, I realized if leveraged my other talents, I could supercharge our underdog team 
by spearheading our marketing, fundraising, and growth. 
I pitched a vision, and the team let me chase it.
