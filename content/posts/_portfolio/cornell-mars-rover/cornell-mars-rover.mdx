  The Cornell Mars Rover team builds an innovative semi-autonomous rover to assist in a future mission to Mars.
</Text>

Cornell Mars Rover was the first group I joined in college as a starry-eyed freshman.
Getting accepted into an engineering project team is a competitive endeavor at Cornell,
so I felt lucky to join 40+ other teammates passionate about the future of space exploration.

The team was founded in 2010, so as one of the newest teams on campus, 
there was plenty of work to do to make the team reach its potential.
Initially, I built up my technical chops by writing code for our rover's Controls Interface. 
But quickly, I realized if leveraged my other talents, I could supercharge our underdog team 
by spearheading our marketing, fundraising, and growth. 
I pitched a vision, and the team let me chase it.

> ‚ÄúArpit and I worked together as a part of the Cornell Mars Rover (CMR) project team for 3 years. 
> During this time Arpit helped transform the team‚Äôs branding, making CMR one of the most recognizable project teams on campus in that span. 
> During his freshman year he took the initiative and redesigned the team‚Äôs website and started working closely with the team‚Äôs business subteam, 
> despite originally being on a completely different subteam. 
>
> As a result of these efforts he became the business subteam lead his sophomore year and reimagined our recruitment and marketing material 
> to give CMR a brand new and improved feel. This resulted in CMR‚Äôs applications more than doubling and its acceptance rate falling to below 15%. 
> Arpit is an extremely talented presenter who has a strong intuition for design and an entrepreneurial mindset that would benefit any team.‚Äù
