  Crater is a revolution in local TV led by a new generation of creators.
</Text>

In college, I spent considerable time exploring how to use AI to solve creative problems.
My curiosity in this space grew as I began to notice the rapid rise of mobile video and
the spiraling decline of local media&mdash;both caused by social media's economic incentives.
I became convinced the booming creator economy needed new cutting-edge tools to fuel a revolution in storytelling.

In November 2017, I recruited a highly creative and deeply technical team
of engineers and designers to pursue this vision.
Together we formed Crater, a synthetic media startup building local TV for a new generation of creators.
We built an AI-powered video production app, got funding, and were featured as an NYC startup to watch.

# Artifacts 🏺

### Pitch Deck
As Co-founder and CEO, I recruited the team, crafted the company vision, and fundraised.
I fundraised $130,000 from pre-seed investors and angels.
This is one of the early investor decks I made.

</Box>

### Product Screenshots

I also managed the product roadmap, tracked sprint OKRs, prototyped features, conducted user interviews, and built our marketing website.
We worked with 50 creators in a private beta and garnered 1,700+ people on our waitlist.
These product screenshots are a culmination of some of that work.

#### Research

In addition the technical and product challenges, our team was motivated by the social impact of making space online for local storytelling.
We did a deep-dive into internet content culture and the role of technology and media in a democracy.
This was some of my favorite research to reference early on.
