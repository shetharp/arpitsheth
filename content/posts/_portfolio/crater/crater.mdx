  Crater is a revolution in local TV led by a new generation of creators.
</Text>

In college, I spent considerable time exploring how to use AI to solve creative problems.
My curiosity in this space grew as I began to notice the rapid rise of mobile video and
the spiraling decline of local media&mdash;both caused by social media's the economic incentives.
I became convinced the booming creator economy needed new cutting-edge tools to fuel a revolution in storytelling.

In November 2017, I recruited a highly creative and deeply technical team
of engineers and designers to pursue this vision.
Together we formed Crater, a synthetic media startup building local TV for a new generation of creators.
We built an AI-powered video production app, got funding, and were featured as an NYC startup to watch.

As Co-founder and CEO, I recruited the team, crafted the company vision, and fundraised.
Here is one of the early investor decks I made.
