#### Welcome to my corner of the universe! 👽

The internet is _a lot of crazy things._
But I believe your own website is a sacred place where we celebrate
courage, not perfection; authenticity, not extravagence.
This is my homebase.

I’m trying to get better at _learning in public._
So, some things I share might be half-baked, or I might change my mind as I learn more.
I’m going to say what I beleive and work even harder to be correct.
But, mistakes happen. If I make one, I’ll be honest about it and learn from it.
This website is where I get to [express myself](/), [iterate on ideas](/blog), and reflect on my growth.

<!-- TODO Link "reflect on my growth" to /readme page -->

If you have thoughtful feedback for me, please [let me know](/contact)!
