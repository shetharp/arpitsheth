This is a guide on how I operate and ways that we can work better together.
It certainly isn&apos;t meant to be prescriptive.
Rather, I hope this guide sparks a dialogue about how we can best complement one another
and develop a solid foundation for an effective working relationship.

# _&ldquo;Work hard with friends&rdquo;_

That&apos;s my work mantra. I've developed it over the years, but much of it stems from the time I spent cutting my teeth working at ambitious early-stage startups.
I know first-hand how a small group of tight-knit, talented individuals working together can achieve the impossible.
As such, my work style ranks high on the **enterprising** and **relational** dimensions.

#### Enterprising

I bring an enterprising work ethic to help teams do original work.
My first order of business is typically to flatten strict hierarchies and broker interdisciplinary collaboration.
This leads to a team culture where people are courageous and ideas are creative.
Once people feel that they can &ldquo;lead from anywhere&rdquo;,
we can leverage this conviction to make calculated investments in an array of possible futures.

#### Relational

All successful relationships are successful for the same reasons.
My approach is to encourage two-way vulnerability, confidence, and consistency between us.
If we do it right, we'll build a trusting foundation early on that we can collectively build on top of overtime.

I also believe that fulfilling relationships are a prerequisite for ambition.
I like to view my teammates as well-rounded people and strive to maximize our time together at work in a way that enriches our lives holistically.
So, I have little patience for people who wield their competency and ambition like a weapon that fractures team trust.
I like to win&mdash;but not at the cost of fomenting a selfish and hostile environment.
My experience has taught me that when we care earnestly about one another, competency multiplies.

## üíé Core Values

My Core Values describe _why_ I act the way I do.
They reflect my priorities when it comes to decision making.
I don't expect others to share all the same values, but I'll work to find harmony between us.

## üß© Complementary Areas

As I get better at harnessing my strengths, I've grown to appreciate the strengths of others.
By relying on each other's complementary qualities, we can round out our team's talent profile.
Here are some areas I appreciate getting help in:

- I love working across functional areas because that's how I explore my appreciation and curiosity for a given problem space. Despite my best intentions, some new teammates might think I'm being a smartass. Please just tell me, and I'll adapt how I work&mdash;I'm a generalist after all.
- Because I have a mission-driven approach to work, busy work that feels directionless is likely to burn me out. If you sense my motivation dipping, try to help me understand how my work rolls up to an ambitious vision and the scope of my impact to date.
- My strengths in design, communication, and insightfulness cause me to be detail-oriented. Occasionally I might fall into a nit-picking rabbit-hole, so please yank me out and let me know if the situation calls for speed and scrappiness.
- If my projects aren't technically challenging enough, see if you can help me add on teaching, coaching, or community building opportunities to leverage my relational work style.

Lastly, I exhibit my best work ethic when at least one of my teammates has a bias for action.
