This is a guide about how I operate and ways that we can work better together.
It certainly isn&apos;t meant to be prescriptive.
Rather, I hope this guide sparks a dialogue about how we can best complement one another
and develop a solid foundation for an effective working relationship.

# _&ldquo;Work hard with friends&rdquo;_

That&apos;s my work mantra. I've developed it over the years, but much of it stems from the time I spent cutting my teeth working at ambitious early-stage startups.
I know first-hand how a small group of tight-knit, talented individuals working together can achieve the impossible.
As such, my work style ranks high on the **enterprising** and **relational** dimensions.

#### Enterprising

I bring an enterprising work ethic to help teams imagine possible futures.
Because I fundamentally believe that people can &ldquo;lead from anywhere&rdquo;,
I work hard to cultivate a creative and courageous enviornment for all types of people and ideas.
Typically, this involves flattening strict hierarchies and promoting interdisciplinary collaboration.
If we achieve this, we'll get to reap the rewards of a team that's open to new experiences and resourceful in combating risks.

#### Relational

All successful relationships are successful for the same reasons.
My approach is is to encourage two-way vulnerability, confidence, and consistency between us.
If we do it right, we'll build a trusting foundation early on that we can collectively build on top of over time.

I also tend to value relationships more than ambition and competency.
I like to view my teammates as well-rounded people and strive to maximize our time together at work in a way that enriches our lives holistically.
So, I have little patience for highly competent people who pursue ambition wrecklessly to the point that they strain relationships and create selfish, toxic enviornments.
My experience has taught me that when we earnestly care about one another, competency multiplies.

## 💎 Core Values

My Core Values describe _why_ I act the way I do.
They reflect my priorities when it comes to decision making.
