**I built this website out of love for my craft.**

I picked up graphic design as a hobby in middle school and eventually taught myself web development.
I put these skills to use out of urgency during the 2010 economic recession
as I helped local small businesses and community organizations establish an online presence.
I got my first real taste of entrepreneurship as a high school sophomore
and continued consulting on the side for several more years.

Since my early days, design has fueled my growth as an entrepreneur and technology leader.
It continues to influence my creativity and human-centric obsession in all the work I do.
