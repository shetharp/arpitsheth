Each of these instruments were made on an Arduino using a variety of sensors (piezoelectric vibration sensors for the drums, flex sensor for the guitar string, and a distance sensor for the termin). Additionally, we integrated a Blue Yeti microphone with a Raspberry Pi. Someone has to sing the vocals!</p>\n<p>The Arduinio (with its instruments) plugs into the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi runs a web server that provides a web interface for a DJ to play music and modify the sounds of each of the instruments.</p>\n<p>Finally, we used a seperate Arduino to create an <strong>Infinity Mirror Music Vizualizer.</strong>\nThe infinity mirror was made with a strip of RGB LEDs glued around a circular rim, which was sandwiched between a mirror and a one-way mirror. We used a graphic equilizer chip to split the audio into six bands. Each band was mapped to a row of LEDs in the infinity mirror.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://github.com/TheResistanceBand/theResistanceBand/wiki/Music-Visualizer\">View On GitHub</a></h2>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Resistance Band 🎼"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/dev/music/"}}
