# Install the Polaroid Theme

1. Add the theme as a dependency to your Gatsby site.

```shell
npm i --save @shetharp/gatsby-theme-polaroid
# or
yarn add @shetharp/gatsby-theme-polaroid
```

2. Add the theme to your `gatsby-config.js` file

```js:title=gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: ["@shetharp/gatsby-theme-polaroid"],
};
```

3. Modify the [theme options](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-themes/tree/master/themes/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog) and site metadata in your `gatsby-config.js` file.

4. Create `.mdx` files for your site's pages or posts. By default this should be in your site's `content/posts` and `content/pages` directories. You should create these directories if they don't already exist.

5. Shadow, override, and customize the theme to fit your needs. See the list of features below for more info.

# Start with the Polaroid Workspace

1. start developing your own theme using this repo as a starting point:

```shell
gatsby new gatsby-theme-custom https://github.com/shetharp/gatsby-theme-polaroid
cd gatsby-theme-custom
yarn
yarn workspace demo develop
```

_Replace `gatsby-theme-custom` with whatever you wish to name your theme._

2. The `theme` workspace directory contains the components, styles, and theme configurations.

   - You should update the `package.json` to match the details for your theme (such as name, author, repository, etc.)
   - This workspace can be used to publish your theme as its own npm package

3. The `demo` workspace directory contains the content, components, and styles for an example site that consumes the theme.

   - You should update the `package.json` to include your theme as a dependency. Make sure the name of the dependency matches the name in your theme's `package.json` file!
   - You should then update the `gatsby-config.js` to include your theme as a plugin
   - This workspace can be used to deploy a demo site for your theme
