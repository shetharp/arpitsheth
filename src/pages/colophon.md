I've been teaching myself web development since 2008.
I built this website to practice my craft, iterate on ideas, and learn from potential mistakes along the way.
If I can help clarify something for your own learning, please don't hesitate to [reach out](/contact).

Hand-coded in JavaScript with [React](http://reactjs.org/) &amp; [Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.org/).
I implemented the design with [styled-components](http://styled-components.com/).
Hosted on GitHub Pages.

Typeset in [Space Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Mono) and [URW DIN](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/urw-din).

The initials in my logo were designed by myself on an 8pt grid in Adobe Illustrator. The wordmark uses Space Mono bold with optical kerning.

I also designed the [confetti icons](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yyQrUh0kTjj05GLBck5dpczWnwB8iTMK?usp=sharing) used throughout the site. Feel free to download and use them! üéâ

All [photography](https://www.instagram.com/shetharp/) is my original work and is mostly shot on a Sony a6000.
