Hi, I'm Arpit. I am a product-obsessed engineer and designer based in New York City. 🗽
Currently, I work as a software engineer at WeWork.

I've built products and led teams in energetic, creative, and technical environments.
Previously, I founded my own startup, Crater.
I went to Cornell University for undergrad and am also a graduate of the Cornell Tech Master of Engineering program.

_I've been teaching myself web development since 2008.
I built this website to practice my craft, iterate on ideas, and learn from potential mistakes along the way.
Please [share your thoughts](/contact) with me or see what's [under the hood.](/colophon)_
